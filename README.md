#Tree - Basic Concepts

1. Definition

A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is a non-linear data structure used for organizing data efficiently.

2. Terminology

Node: A basic unit of a tree containing data.

Root: The topmost node of the tree.

Parent Node: A node that has child nodes.

Child Node: A node that descends from another node (parent).

Sibling Nodes: Nodes that share the same parent.

Leaf Node: A node without children.

Edge: A connection between two nodes.

Path: A sequence of nodes connected by edges.

Height of a Node: The number of edges in the longest path from the node to a leaf.

Depth of a Node: The number of edges from the root to that node.

Height of a Tree: The height of the root node (longest path to a leaf).

Degree of a Node: The number of children a node has.

3. Types of Trees

General Tree: A tree where each node can have any number of children.

Binary Tree: A tree where each node has at most two children (left and right).

Full Binary Tree: A binary tree in which every node has 0 or 2 children.

Complete Binary Tree: A binary tree where all levels are completely filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.

Perfect Binary Tree: A binary tree where all leaf nodes are at the same level and all internal nodes have two children.

Balanced Binary Tree: A binary tree where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differs by at most one.

Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left child contains smaller values, and the right child contains larger values.

4. Tree Traversal Methods

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Preorder (Root → Left → Right)

Inorder (Left → Root → Right)

Postorder (Left → Right → Root)

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Level Order Traversal: Visit nodes level by level.

5. Applications of Trees

Hierarchical data representation (e.g., file systems).

Searching (e.g., Binary Search Tree).

Network routing (e.g., spanning trees).

Expression evaluation (e.g., expression trees).

Artificial intelligence (e.g., decision trees).
